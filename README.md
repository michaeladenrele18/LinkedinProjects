Welcome to my Project portfolio! This repository showcases some of the key projects I've worked on, highlighting my skills in Python programming, software development, and problem-solving.

Each project has its own folder with detailed information about the project, including how it was built, the problem it solves, and instructions for running the code.

Projects:

1. [Finance Tracker](./finance-tracker)
   A personal finance tracking system that allows users to monitor income and expenses, set budgets, and view financial summaries.
   This project demonstrates my ability to build data-driven applications and handle file I/O in Python.
2. [Derivative Calculator](./derivative-calculator)
   A tool for calculating the derivatives of mathematical functions. This project showcases my skills in mathematical computation and algorithm development using Python. I initially developed this tool to solve a
   challenging calculus problem during my freshman year, which allowed me to better understand the concepts of differentiation and helped streamline complex calculations in my coursework.
3. [Hotel Management System](
