Welcome to my Project portfolio! This repository showcases some of the key projects I've worked on, highlighting my skills in Python programming, software development, and problem-solving.

Each project has its own folder with detailed information about the project, including how it was built, the problem it solves, and instructions for running the code.

Projects:

1. [Finance Tracker](./finance-tracker)
   A personal finance tracking system that allows users to monitor income and expenses, set budgets, and view financial summaries.
   This project demonstrates my ability to build data-driven applications and handle file I/O in Python.
2. [Derivative Calculator](./derivative-calculator)
   A tool for calculating the derivatives of mathematical functions. This project showcases my skills in mathematical computation and algorithm development using Python. I initially developed this tool to solve a
   challenging calculus problem during my freshman year, which allowed me to better understand the concepts of differentiation and helped streamline complex calculations in my coursework.
3. [Hotel Management System](./hotel-management-system)
   A Python-based system for managing hotel reservations, room service orders, and billing. This project highlights my proficiency in object-oriented programming and managing complex data structures. I developed this
   system as part of a hackathon, where I worked in a group of four. Each team member was responsible for a different part of the system—reservations, room service, billing, and system integration—allowing us to
   collaboratively build a comprehensive solution.
